    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    </u>
        <p>Hi, my name is Sakari Liesjärvi. I'm originally from Mouhijärvi but I moved to Tampere 5 months ago. Furthermore, I'm a student at Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK).
            I decided to study Information Technology because I have always been interested in computers and electronics.</p>
            <p>Before I came to TAMK, I was sure that I wasn't going to like coding. However now that I have learnt a little bit of C++ and HTML, I can happily say that programming is actually quite fun.</p>
